Spanning 1.7 miles across the Golden Gate strait, this Art Deco masterpiece was designed by engineer Joseph Strauss and architect Irving Morrow. The bridge's distinctive International Orange color was chosen to enhance visibility in San Francisco's frequent fog and to complement the natural surroundings. During construction, this was considered an impossible feat due to strong currents, deep water, and persistent fog. Today, it stands as a symbol of American ingenuity and the gateway to San Francisco Bay. On clear days like today, you can see all the way to the Marin Headlands and beyond."
